dcomp:

The directory dcomp/ contains a derivative of the jpeg library.
This is needed to display jpg images. dcomp contains only the DEcompression
part of jpeglib.

If a build fails at the link stage, check whether dcomp is compiled 
correctly.

copydb:

copydb is build separately (make copydb), NOT with make all.
