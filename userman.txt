Satview User Manual

Satview is a little distributed system that can collect and present
weather satellite images for personal use.

Structure
---------
The system consists of three layers:

+ Data Aquisition Layer
+ Satview Storage Layer
+ Satview User Interface Layer

=== Data Aquisition ===

The Data Aquisition Layer is provided by the friendly people who operate
weather satellites, and make their images available to the public. The only
part involving satview is when satview downloads their images. When
implementing this part of satview, care must be taken to respect copyrights
and similar issues. 

Currently data aquisition is done by simple scripts that download images from
well known locations to fixed locations on a Storage Layer server, and then 
store the images from the fixed locations into a database (MySql at this time)
on the server. Currently the server aquiring the images form the 
public sources is the same server that stores the database, although this
is not strictly necessary.

=== Satview Storage Layer ===
The Storage Layer keeps a (MySql) database containing satellite images,
indexed by a time stamp (when the image was aquired) and an image name. It
is assumed that images of the same name represent the same geographical area.
The Storage Layer provides two interfaces to the User Interface Layer:
+ the http Web Interface, and
+ the mysqld 

The mysqld interface is the same as any mysqld interface, nothing new is added 
on the database side.

The Web Interface works with a simple HTTP GET API, which encasulates the
mysqld interface locally on the server. Currently the Web Interface runs
in PHP/Apache on the same server as the mysql database. This is not strictly
speaking necessary (the Web Interface code opens a database connection on
"localhost", it could open a connection anywhere).

=== Satview User Interface ===
The User Interface program loads images from the database server on the
Satview Storage Layer, and displays them in a simple GUI. The Gui allows
stepping through images, or running through a number of sequeltial
images to view short animations. The controls operate much like
tape player controls. The Gui allows the user to change database servers
and change image names, so that different geographical areas can be
observed. The Gui also allows switching the interface to the Storage Layer
between web (HTTP) and direct (mysql) interfaces. 

The User Interface Layer Gui provides an in-memory cache at the user's
side of the system. 

The User Interface Layer also provides a command line program to copy image
data between different Storage Layer servers. This is useful for the (typical)
case where a user perfers to view data from a local server, but the local
server does not do aquisition 24 hours a day.
