Linux
-----

Use make, don't be a wimp.

If you do make install, it will try to put the executable in your 
$(HOME)/bin/ directory. If you are not a self respecting person
who has a $(HOME)/bin/ directory, change or override INSTALLDIR to put it
someplace else.

A remark on fltk: they provide compile and link settings with fltk-config,
don't use that. It will include things you don't want.

Windows
-------

This works in Visual Studio 2008 Express. Even the stuff in the dcomp/
directory. I will post all the settings when I get around to it.

You need to get the FLTK headers and libraries, I'm not shipping those.
This works with fltk 1.1.9, NOT fltk 2. Probably won't work with
fltk 1.3 either. Be advised to NOT USE the fltk jpeg library, it will
conflict with the dcomp/ stuff. Also the fltk jpeg library does not
do what you need for this software, so there is no point in linking
to it.

On windows you also need to link to WinSock2 libraries. I have not
tried to run this on CygWin or minGW. It will probably work with the
right sockets.

I haven't had the patience to use the MySql CPP Connector stuff on Windows.
So for now it's only the web interface on Windows.
