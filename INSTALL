This is now a Qt4 project, so you should use qmake (version 4.x, not 3.x).

There are 2 project files, so do this:

qmake-qt4 cloudtrack.pro
qmake-qt4 copydb.pro

this should create some makefiles, in particular "Makefile" and "Make.copydb".

Then:

make all
make -f Make.copydb all

should produce these executables:

cloudtrackr      - the "release" version
cloudtrackd      - the "debug" version

copydb           - the copydb utility

and that's it.

Windows
-------

I used Qt Creator, with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express tool chain.
Open the project files "cloudtrack.pro" and "copydb.pro" and build from there.
Creator will put the executable in the debug/ and release/ subdirectories


Prerequisits:

Qt4.5
libmysqlconn
