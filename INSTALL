Linux
-----

This is a Qt4 project, so you should use qmake (version 4.x, not 3.x).
You need to have qmake version 4. You also need Qt header files and libraries.

You can edit the file 'qmake.name', so that is has the correct name
for your qmake version 4 in it. If you don't change 'qmake.name' it uses
qmake-qt4.

To build, type

make all

this should produce these executables:

cloudtrack       - the "release" version
cloudtrackd      - the "debug" version
copydb           - the copydb utility

and that's it.

Windows
-------

I used Qt Creator, with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express tool chain.
Open the project file "cloud.pro" build from there.

Creator will put the executable in the debug/ and release/ subdirectories
and in the qcopy/debug and qcopy/release subdirectories.
